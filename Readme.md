# Climate Change & Natural Disasters: Global Impact Analysis 🌍

An in-depth exploratory data analysis investigating the relationship between global climate change and natural disasters, focusing on their occurrence rates and economic implications.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of global temperature changes and their correlation with natural disaster patterns. Using Python and various data science libraries, we explore decades of climate and disaster data to uncover meaningful insights about our changing planet.

### Key Findings

- 🌡️ Earth has experienced consistent warming trends since approximately 1920
- 🌪️ Strong positive correlation exists between global temperature rise and natural disaster frequency
- 💰 Economic impact shows moderate correlation with global warming, influenced by multiple factors

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
